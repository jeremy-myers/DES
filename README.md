# DES
Discrete Event Simulation in several languages.
C and Java versions of the code are available at `http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/` 

## C
Original source C code from Discrete Event Simulation: A First Course (by Leemis and Park) 
Credit: Steve Park, Larry Leemis, and Dave Geyer. 

## Python
Translated into Python 3.3 from `https://github.com/pdsteele/DES-Python`.

Run any of the programs with 'python3 filename.py'

To run a program with a datafile, you can run either 'cat data.dat | python3
file.py' or 'python3 file.py < data.dat'. The latter will not work in
Powershell/Cmd if you use Windows. 

## Rust
TBD...
